    <p class="title text-light">These did not come out quite right as you can see. I am not entirely sure why
        but I am pretty sure it may be something to do with the roll being developed/scanned
        with the roll of Lomography purple that is also on the site, maybe the scanner settings
        got messed up. Regardless I have a grayscale version of this roll on the site as well to
        try and salvage something from this.</p>

    <p class="title text-light">This is the grayscale version of the Ektachrome 200 roll with scans that were not
        quite right. I have not put much effort in here yet, I just edited one photo and applied that
        to all the others so some could use some changes, but this will do for now.</p>

{% if prefix == "zorki-4k" %}
    <p class="title text-light">This is the first time I have ever used this camera, and a rangefinder as well.
        This was one of two rolls I shot to try it out and it shows potential, although there are some light leaks
        and seemingly cut off frames, but I have left these in as this was my first experience with the camera so it
        feels worth including. I did have some difficulty with winding/rewinding the film properly, and the frame
        counter did reset part way, so maybe that is something to do with it. I may right a more in-depth post about
        this camera and how I feel about it so far, but I will be using it again in the future.</p>
